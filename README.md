A modified Canvas tutorial from Wes Bos featuring a color selector and the ability to export a .PNG.

## Getting Started
Draw with the mouse. The clear button will clear the canvas. The save button will export the file to a transparent .PNG that can be downloaded. The pick color button will open a menu where a new color can be selected. Click the button again to close the menu.
